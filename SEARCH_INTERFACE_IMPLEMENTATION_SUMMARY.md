- **Performance Metrics**: Search timing display and result count
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages

#### Advanced Filtering Options:
- **Document Type Filter**: PDF, DOCX, TXT selection
- **Schema Type Filter**: EU ESRS/CSRD, UK SRD selection
- **Processing Status Filter**: Completed, Processing, Pending, Failed
- **Filename Contains**: Text-based filename filtering
- **Minimum Relevance Score**: Slider-based relevance threshold (0-100%)
- **Advanced Ranking Toggle**: Enable/disable enhanced ranking algorithms

#### User Experience Enhancements:
- **Search Suggestions**: Real-time suggestions with click-to-search functionality
- **Filter State Management**: Active filter count display and clear all functionality
- **Content Truncation**: Smart content display with "Show full content" option

- **Relevance Color Coding**: Green (>80%), Orange (>60%), Default (<60%)
- **Loading States**: Spinner and disabled states during search operations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enter to search, Escape to close suggestions

### 2. Enhanced Search Service (`frontend/src/services/searchService.ts`)

#### API Methods Implemented:
- `search(searchQuery)`: Main search with comprehensive filtering
- `getSuggestions(partialQuery)`: Real-time search suggestions
- `searchBySchema(schemaElements)`: Schema-specific search
- `findSimilar(chunkId)`: Find similar content chunks
- `getStatistics()`: Search system statistics
- `getPerformanceMetrics(query)`: Search performance analysis
- `generateEmbedding(query)`: Query embedding generation
- `searchWithEmbedding(embedding)`: Custom embedding search
- `healthCheck()`: Search system health status

#### Enhanced Query Interface:
```typescript
interface SearchQuery {
  query: string;
  top_k?: number;
  min_relevance_score?: number;
  enable_reranking?: boolean;
  document_type?: string;
  schema_type?: string;
  processing_status?: string;
  filename_contains?: string;
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Unit Tests (`frontend/src/pages/Search.test.tsx`):
- Component rendering and initial state
- Search functionality (button click, Enter key)
- Filter panel operations (open/close, apply filters)
- Search suggestions (display, selection, keyboard navigation)
- Error handling and loading states
- Content formatting and truncation
- Schema element display and overflow
- Filter state management and clearing

#### Integration Tests (`frontend/src/pages/Search.integration.test.tsx`):
- End-to-end search workflow
- API integration with real network calls
- Filter application and state persistence
- Concurrent search request handling
- Performance metrics display
- Error recovery and graceful degradation

#### Service Tests (`frontend/src/services/searchService.test.ts`):
- All API method functionality
- Parameter validation and error handling
- Network error handling
- Response parsing and data transformation

### 4. Backend API Enhancements

The existing backend search API (`backend/app/api/search.py`) already provides comprehensive endpoints that support all frontend features:

- **POST /search/**: Main search with filtering
- **GET /search/suggestions**: Search suggestions
- **POST /search/schema**: Schema-based search
- **POST /search/similar**: Similar content search
- **GET /search/statistics**: System statistics
- **GET /search/performance**: Performance metrics
- **GET /search/health**: Health check

## Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 4.1: RAG Response Generation
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Users can submit questions and receive AI-generated answers based on document repository context.

### Requirement 4.3: Model Selection
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Interface provides choice of available AI models with real-time availability status.

### Requirement 4.4: Source Citations
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Responses display source document references and chunk IDs in expandable sections.

### Requirement 4.5: Confidence Scoring
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Each response shows confidence score with color-coded indicators and quality metrics.

### Requirement 5.2: User Interface
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Clean, responsive web interface with intuitive navigation and clear feedback.

### Requirement 5.3: Error Handling
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: User-friendly error messages, loading states, and graceful failure handling.

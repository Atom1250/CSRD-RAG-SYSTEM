The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a comprehensive EU regulation that requires large companies to report on sustainability matters. Here are the key points:

**Scope and Application:**
- Applies to companies with more than 500 employees or ‚Ç¨40 million in net turnover
- Requires disclosure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts

**Reporting Standards:**
- Companies must follow the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)
- ESRS covers environmental standards (E1-E5), social standards (S1-S4), and governance standards (G1)

**Objectives:**
- Increase transparency in corporate sustainability reporting
- Enhance accountability for sustainability impacts
- Standardize sustainability reporting across the EU

This information is based on the CSRD directive documentation and ESRS standards provided in the context."""

The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are comprehensive standards that provide detailed requirements for sustainability reporting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

**Structure:**
- Environmental Standards (E1-E5): Cover climate change, pollution, water, biodiversity, and circular economy
- Social Standards (S1-S4): Address workforce, value chain workers, affected communities, and consumers  
- Governance Standards (G1): Focus on business conduct and governance practices

**Purpose:**
- Ensure consistent and comparable sustainability reporting across EU companies
- Provide detailed guidance for CSRD compliance
- Establish standardized metrics and disclosure requirements

# Remote Directory Monitoring and Synchronization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive remote directory monitoring and synchronization functionality for the CSRD RAG System. This feature allows automatic monitoring of remote directories and batch processing of documents for ingestion into the system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Models
**File**: `backend/app/models/database.py`

Added two new database models:

#### RemoteDirectoryConfig
- Stores configuration for remote directory monitoring
- Fields: id, name, directory_path, is_active, sync_interval, last_sync_time, file_patterns, exclude_patterns, schema_type, created_at, updated_at

#### RemoteDirectorySync
- Tracks synchronization operations and their results
- Fields: id, config_id, sync_start_time, sync_end_time, files_processed, files_added, files_updated, files_failed, sync_status, error_message, sync_metadata

### 2. Pydantic Schemas
**File**: `backend/app/models/schemas.py`

Added comprehensive schemas for:
- `RemoteDirectoryConfigBase`, `RemoteDirectoryConfigCreate`, `RemoteDirectoryConfigUpdate`, `RemoteDirectoryConfigResponse`
- `RemoteDirectorySyncBase`, `RemoteDirectorySyncCreate`, `RemoteDirectorySyncUpdate`, `RemoteDirectorySyncResponse`
- `RemoteDirectoryFilters`, `RemoteDirectorySyncFilters`

### 3. Configuration Settings
**File**: `backend/app/core/config.py`

Added remote directory settings:
- `remote_directory_sync_interval`: Default sync interval (300 seconds)
- `remote_directory_batch_size`: Files per batch (10)
- `remote_directory_max_file_age`: Maximum file age for processing (24 hours)
- `enable_remote_directory_monitoring`: Enable/disable monitoring

### 4. Core Service Implementation
**File**: `backend/app/services/remote_directory_service.py`

Implemented `RemoteDirectoryService` with comprehensive functionality:

#### Configuration Management
- `create_remote_directory_config()`: Create new remote directory configurations
- `get_remote_directory_configs()`: List configurations with filtering
- `get_remote_directory_config_by_id()`: Get specific configuration
- `update_remote_directory_config()`: Update configuration
- `delete_remote_directory_config()`: Delete configuration

#### File Discovery and Filtering
- `_get_files_to_process()`: Discover files in remote directory
- `_matches_file_patterns()`: Apply include/exclude patterns
- `_is_file_recent_enough()`: Check file age
- `_should_process_file()`: Check if file needs processing (avoid duplicates)

#### Synchronization Operations
- `sync_remote_directory()`: Sync specific directory
- `sync_all_active_directories()`: Sync all active directories
- `_perform_sync()`: Core sync logic with batch processing
- `_process_file_batch()`: Process files in batches
- `_is_sync_due()`: Check if sync is needed based on interval

#### Logging and Monitoring
- `get_sync_logs()`: Retrieve sync operation logs
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Progress tracking during sync operations

### 5. API Endpoints
**File**: `backend/app/api/remote_directories.py`

Implemented REST API endpoints:
- `POST /api/remote-directories/`: Create configuration
- `GET /api/remote-directories/`: List configurations (with filters)
- `GET /api/remote-directories/{id}`: Get specific configuration
- `PUT /api/remote-directories/{id}`: Update configuration
- `DELETE /api/remote-directories/{id}`: Delete configuration
- `POST /api/remote-directories/{id}/sync`: Trigger sync for specific directory
- `POST /api/remote-directories/sync-all`: Sync all active directories
- `GET /api/remote-directories/{id}/sync-logs`: Get sync logs for configuration
- `GET /api/remote-directories/sync-logs/`: Get all sync logs (with filters)

### 6. Celery Tasks for Automation
**File**: `backend/app/tasks/remote_directory_sync.py`

Implemented background tasks:
- `sync_remote_directory_task`: Async task for single directory sync
- `sync_all_remote_directories_task`: Async task for batch sync
- `schedule_remote_directory_sync`: Periodic task scheduler
- Configured periodic execution every 5 minutes

### 7. Integration with Main Application
**File**: `backend/main.py`

- Added remote directories router to main application
- Integrated with existing API structure

- ✅ Duplicate detection using file hashes

### 3. Batch Processing

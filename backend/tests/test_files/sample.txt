This is a sample text file for testing text extraction functionality.

It contains multiple paragraphs with different types of content.

The text processing service should be able to extract this content and chunk it appropriately for further processing.

This paragraph contains some technical terms related to sustainability reporting, such as CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards).

The chunking algorithm should respect sentence boundaries and create meaningful chunks that preserve context for downstream processing.
